hi..
with a simple idea to create a platform for close friends with coding interests to have a common platform to look how each other are doing and help each other progress :)

few points under initial idea:
- cute-dark theme ofc
- real-time data manipulation via apis
- current focus on codeforces platform itself
- as of now this platform is for 2 coders only, but still have that user profile options to view my added connections
- we might use daily submission heatmap like in codeforces/leetcode/etc
- Real-time chat (DMs)
- Global vs. friend comparison graphs
- Language usage chart
- Tag mastery charts
- Streak tracker (days solved in a row)
- Rating change over time
- Problem difficulty distribution
- Algorithm family mastery
- Weekly/monthly summary
- we can add notification feature in response to different triggers
- problem bookmarking
- upcoming contest list
- Auto-subscribe to contest reminders
- Countdown timers to contests
- study material zone
- Tip of the day (algorithm concept)
- endpoints under /home: none just blogs
- endpoints under /contests: /problems, /my_submissions, /status
- endpoints under /problemset: /problems, /submit, /status
- endpoints under /profile: /<username>, /settings, /blog
