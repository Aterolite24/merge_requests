hi..
with a simple idea to create a platform for close friends with coding interests to have a common platform to look how each other are doing and help each other progress :)

few points under initial idea:
- cute-dark theme ofc
- real-time data manipulation via apis
- current focus on codeforces platform itself
- as of now this platform is for 2 coders only
- we might use daily submission heatmap like in codeforces/leetcode/etc
- endpoints under /home: none just blogs
- endpoints under /contests: /problems, /my_submissions, /status
- endpoints under /problemset: /problems, /submit, /status
- endpoints under /profile: /<username>, /settings, /blog
